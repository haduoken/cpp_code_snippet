/**
 * A simple 2D pose slam example
 *  - The robot moves in a 2 meter square
 *  - The robot moves 2 meters each step, turning 90 degrees after each step
 *  - The robot initially faces along the X axis (horizontal, to the right in 2D)
 *  - We have full odometry between pose
 *  - We have a loop closure constraint when the robot returns to the first position
 *                    x5 -- x4

// Each variable in the system (poses and landmarks) must be identified with a unique key.
// We can either use simple integer keys (1, 2, 3, ...) or symbols (X1, X2, L1).
// Here we will use Symbols
#include <gtsam/inference/Symbol.h>

// We want to use iSAM2 to solve the pose optimazation problem incrementally, so
// include iSAM2 here
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/ISAM2.h>

// iSAM2 requires as input a set set of new factors to be added stored in a factor graph,
// and initial guesses for any new variables used in the added factors
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/NonlinearFactorGraph.h>

#include <vector>

// In planar SLAM example we use Pose2 variables (x, y, theta) to represent the robot poses
#include <gtsam/geometry/Pose2.h>

// We will use simple integer Keys to refer to the robot poses.
#include <gtsam/inference/Key.h>

// In GTSAM, measurement functions are represented as 'factors'. Several common factors
// have been provided with the library for solving robotics/SLAM/Bundle Adjustment problems.
// Here we will use Between factors for the relative motion described by odometry measurements.
// We will also use a Between Factor to encode the loop closure constraint
// Also, we will initialize the robot at the origin using a Prior factor.
#include <gtsam/slam/BetweenFactor.h>
#include <gtsam/slam/PriorFactor.h>

// The nonlinear solvers within GTSAM are iterative solvers, meaning they linearize the
// nonlinear functions around an initial linearization point, then solve the linear system
// to update the linearization point. This happens repeatedly until the solver converges
// to a consistent set of variable values. This requires us to specify an initial guess
// for each variable, held in a Values container.
